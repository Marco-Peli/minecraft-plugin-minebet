# Disclaimer
This software is very old. It was developed sometime during a hot summer in 2012 or 2013 when this idea came to my mind and I really wanted to put it into code. It was created in about two weeks, mostly at night after university classes.

I stumbled across this software in my private cloud archive in 2021 and decided to put it online with a renovated user guide because... why not.

It comes with no expectations of working perfectly, but it has been thoroughly tested on a real SpigotMC server ranked among the top positions in Italy. Additionally, the code is mostly decently-structured.

I stumbled across this software again in 2025 and decided to add this introduction and upload the PDF containing the documentation directly into this repo, since the previously linked website will probably be soon discontinued.

Minecraft has been my mainly-played game for quite some time, and allowed me to meet a lot of good people during the many years I have played it. I hope that you will enjoy this game as much as I did.
